Iâ€™m excited about k3s. I was running k3s in my local setup for a long time. Recently I set up a multi-node Kubernetes using Raspberry Pi and k3s. This repo contains the steps for that.

1. [Boot Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/shovanmaity/k3s-with-pi/blob/master/boot-pi.md)
2. [Configure Kubernetes master](https://github.com/shovanmaity/k3s-with-pi/blob/master/configure-master.md)
3. [Configure Kubernetes worker](https://github.com/shovanmaity/k3s-with-pi/blob/master/configure-worker.md)
4. [Export kubeconfig](https://github.com/shovanmaity/k3s-with-pi/blob/master/export-kubeconfig.md)
